# gittology
A test repository to learn GIT basics (commit/pull/push/branch/merge)

### Why

Out of sheer necessity we needed a way to let other team members, like designers, a way to test basic GIT actions (committing and pushing files, pulling from a repository). As always practice makes perfect, so I decided to create a GitHub repository for testing purposes.

### Structure

Ideally we have different meaningful branches that can be used to perform the basic GIT operations, plus it could be used to experience the most basic case of conflict, rebase and squashed merge.

### How

`$ git clone https://github.com/Objectway/gittology.git`

### Basic operations
